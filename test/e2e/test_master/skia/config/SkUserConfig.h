/*  Skia has lots of debug-only code. Often this is just null checks or other
    parameter checking, but sometimes it can be quite intrusive (e.g. check that
    each 32bit pixel is in premultiplied form). This code can be very useful
    during development, but will slow things down in a shipping product.

    By default, these mutually exclusive flags are defined in SkPreConfig.h,
    based on the presence or absence of NDEBUG, but that decision can be changed
    here.
